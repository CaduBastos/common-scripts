This repository serves as a **personal code laboratory** focused on **Electrical Engineering
and Embedded Systems studies**. It contains small programs, scripts, and reusable components
developed for academic learning, technical practice, and experimentation with low-level
and system-oriented software.

The content reflects hands-on experience acquired during coursework and independent study,
and it is part of my **professional GitHub portfolio**.

## Technical Focus

The repository includes materials related to:

- **Embedded and low-level programming** in C and C++  
- **Python and Shell scripting** for automation, testing, and analysis  
- **Reusable header files** for embedded and systems projects  
- **Small tools and utilities** supporting engineering workflows  

## Purpose

- Academic and self-directed learning  
- Skill development in software for embedded and system-level applications  
- Reference implementations and experimental code  

## Notes

- Code is primarily intended for study and experimentation  
- Readability and concept demonstration are prioritized over optimization  
- Content may evolve as new topics and tools are explored
